    <summary>The story</summary>
    <br />

    So i recently went on a trip and saw a chromecast showing to connect to the guest wifi,
    then go to this website (getstreaming.tv) and enter this 9 digit code.
    Then its says its all good and just cast from that device.
    And it only showed that device of your room and no one elses and it did it through a WEBSITE! First off how does that work and espcially on iOS where its locked down? And I looked into it but was not able to capture network packets so i had to learn the hard way. (other people in my room were using the TV at the time.)

This project uses prisma and node js. I used this to learn prisma and cast framework from google mainly.
Plus SONFI made it for businesses only, why cant we have it and free as well? (prob cause its on there servers but yeah you get what the point.)
